Nim Script Loader written in C++

Compile with:

g++ -o nimx nimx.cpp

Use with e.g. this she-bang:

#!/usr/local/bin/nimx

* Better than using restricted NimScript - you can use the full Nim command set
* No complicated she-bang line with unnecessary arguments
* Caches compiled files in  ~/.nimx - not clobbering your script folder
* Uses stdin piping to allow all characters in the filename. Standard nim doesn't allow dash ("-") for example.

I'd recommend you also checkout these and see what you like best:
